Description: Implements two statistical tests from VanderWeele and Vansteelandt
    (2022, JRSS-B) to reject the structural interpretation of a univariate
    latent factor model. The T0 test (Section 3.2) depends on reliability
    estimates and requires d >= 3 indicators and p >= 2 Z-levels. The T1 test
    (Section 3.3) is reliability-independent and requires d >= 2 indicators
    and p >= 3 Z-levels.
